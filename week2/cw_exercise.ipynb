You gain more points the faster you answer a question, and also get bonus points for answering consecutive questions correctly (called a streak). At the end, we get to see who won! It's also possible to make your own quizzes, with custom questions and answers."

    "    - ***Streak score:*** depends on the value of `self.current_streak`. Kicks in when the player correctly answers at least 2 questions in a row. Got 2 correct in a row? Your streak score is **200** points. 3 in a row? **400** points. 4 in a row? **600** points. 5 in a row? **800** points. The pattern continues.\n",
