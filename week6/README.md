# The Cleanup Week

Not been given a clear spec on this, so let's talk about efficiency and best practices.

- How not to O(heat death of the universe)
    - Data structures
    - Algorithms
    - Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Caching
    - Don't use python
- Making python files work together
- Compactness but make it not cursed (list comprehensions, lambda, etc)
