    "### A Quick Detour: Efficiency and Big-Oh\n",
    "If the first bubble sort we wrote worked, then why did we improve it? It has to do with *code efficiency*. Often, there are lots of different implementations that solve the same problem. The best solutions will run the fastest, and use the least amount additional storage space. Many of the constructs you've learned over the past weeks will help with writing efficient code, such as:\n",
    "- Using loops for repeated actions\n",
    "- Using data structures instead of separate variables\n",
    "- Using functions if you're going to be repeating the same blocks of actions throughout your code\n",
    "- Use of in-built features / external code libraries\n",
    "- Use of recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "A fairly common notation you'll see when talking about the efficiency of algorithms is **Big-Oh notation O()**. Big-Oh gives us an upper bound to the growth rate of an algorithm as the input size *n* increases. \n",
    "Big-Oh has a couple of basic rules:\n",
    "- If your run time is a polynomial of degree *d*, then the run time is O(nᵈ). You drop any lower-order and constant terms (as n increases, the nᵈ term grows the fastest)\n",
    "- Use the *smallest possible* class of function\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider going one by one through a list of *n* elements. As we add more elements to the list, it's going to take longer to visit all of the elements. The time varies linearly (hence the term *linear search*) with input size, so we say it runs in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the bubble and insertion sorts we wrote in the previous section run in O(n²) time. That means that the run time of our algorithms grow proportional to the **square** of the size of the input. For smaller inputs, it's not a huge problem, but if were sorting arrays with thousands of elements, things would quickly get out of hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to say that there aren't *worse* sorting algorithms out there. The ***Bogosort*** has no upper bound on its runtime (aka O(∞)) and an **average** runtime of O((n+1)!). We're not going to bother with a Python implementation (you can attempt it if you really want, check Python's `random` library to help), but the pseudocode for the randomised Bogosort is:\n",
