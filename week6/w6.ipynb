The best solutions will run the fastest, and use the least amount additional storage space. Many of the constructs you've learned over the past weeks will help with writing efficient code, such as:\n",
    "- Using loops for repeated actions\n",
    "- Using data structures instead of separate variables\n",

    "- Use of in-built features / external code libraries\n",
    "- Use of recursion\n",

That means that the run time of our algorithms grow proportional to the **square** of the size of the input. For smaller inputs, it's not a huge problem, but if were sorting arrays with thousands of elements, things would quickly get out of hand.\n",

Think about how the binary search works: if we don't find the element, we discard part of the list. To be exact, since we choose the pivot as the midpoint of the list, we discard *half* of the list. That means the binary search reduces our search space by half... at every iteration. So the expected number of pivots we check is log2(n), where n is the initial size of the array.\n",
