    "A fairly common notation you'll see when talking about the efficiency of algorithms is **Big-Oh notation O()**. Big-Oh gives us an upper bound to the growth rate of an algorithm as the input size *n* increases. \n",
    "Big-Oh has a couple of basic rules:\n",
    "- If your run time is a polynomial of degree *d*, then the run time is O(nᵈ). You drop any lower-order and constant terms (as n increases, the nᵈ term grows the fastest)\n",
    "- Use the *smallest possible* class of function\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider going one by one through a list of *n* elements. As we add more elements to the list, it's going to take longer to visit all of the elements. The time varies linearly (hence the term *linear search*) with input size, so we say it runs in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the bubble and insertion sorts we wrote in the previous section run in O(n²) time. That means that the run time of our algorithms grow proportional to the **square** of the size of the input. For smaller inputs, it's not a huge problem, but if were sorting arrays with thousands of elements, things would quickly get out of hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not to say that there aren't *worse* sorting algorithms out there. The ***Bogosort*** has no upper bound on its runtime (aka O(∞)) and an **average** runtime of O((n+1)!). Here's a lovely implementation of it below, and an example list of 12 numbers for it to sort. Go on, give it a run!"

    "### Coding Practices\n",
    "80% of coding is knowing how to code, the remaining 20% is knowing how to code *nicely*. That means writing your code bearing in mind that someone else might have to read it, and they won't want to spend much effort trying to figure out what you're trying to do (it also helps avoid the \"what was I thinking\" moments when you go back to debug your code). The general term for confusing, unclear, badly written code is ***Spaghetti Code***. We want to avoid spaghetti code as much as possible, otherwise we end up with code like this:"
